    "                          Ingredients of Pizza - \n

        2 cup all purpose flour.\n
        100 ml tomato ketchup\n
        1 tomato\n
        2 onion\n
        1 teaspoon chilli flakes \n
        1 teaspoon baking powder\n
        1 teaspoon sugar. \n
        100 gm processed cheese\n
        4 mushroom\n
        1/2 capsicum\n
        1 teaspoon oregano \n
        1/2 cup mozzarella \n
        1 tablespoon dry yeast \n\n


        "                       How to Make Pizza \n
        1. Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose
            flour to it. Next, add salt and baking powder in
            it and sieve the flour once. Then, make a well in
            centre and add 1 teaspoon of oil to it. On the other
            hand, take a little warm water and mix the yeast in
            it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and
            keep aside for 10-15 minutes. The yeast will rise
            in the meantime. Once the yeast has risen, add it
            to the flour knead the dough nicely using some
            water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours.
            Then knead the dough once again.
            Now, the pizza dough is ready.\n\n
        2. Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the
            time to make the pizza base when the dough is
            ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour
            and take a large amount of the pizza dough.
            Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into
            a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the
            circular base is even at all ends.) Once you
            have made the base,use a fork and prick the base
            with it so that the base doesn\'t rise and gets
            baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and
            bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.\n\n
        3. wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then
            peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in
            another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms
            in the same manner. However, make sure that those
            tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the
            veggies are done,Now, grate the processed and
            mozzarella cheese in separate
            bowls. \n\n
        4. take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all
            over.Spread half the processed cheese all over the
            base and evenly put the veggies all across the base.
            Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick
            layer of mozzarella cheese.\n\n
        5.  Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the
             oven. Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at 250 degree
             Celsius.Once done, take out the baking tray and slice
             the pizza.Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes as per
             your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that
             the oven is preheated at 250 degree Celsius for 5 minutes
             at least.)\n\n
        "                        Tip-\n\n
         * One of the basic tips is to make sure that you
            have preheated the oven. In case you are using
            a standard oven then make sure it’s preheated
            at 280 degree Celsius.\n
         * In case you are using a readymade base, make
            sure it’s not cold.Make sure that you take
            it out half an hour before you start making
            the pizza.\n
         * Don’t roll the dough, stretch it to make the base.
            This means if you are making the fresh pizza
            base,the dough will be at room temperature
            and it would be easy to stretch it.\n
         * The best way to make restaurant-style pizza is to
            use a pizza stone, as it helps the dough in rising
            and makes it crisp as well. Go for it.\n
         * If you want to use an organic approach in your
            pizza,then you can use the fresh tomato puree
            or paste.This will make your pizza more
            delicious.\n

    "                         Ingredients of Fried Chicken - \n

    1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces.\n
    1 cup buttermilk \n
    2 cups all-purpose flour for coating\n
    1 teaspoon paprika\n
    salt and pepper to taste \n
    2 quarts vegetable oil for frying\n\n


                       How to Make Fried Chicken \n
    1. Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them
        if you prefer. Put the flour in a large
        plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you
        are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).
        Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper
        to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken)\n\n
    2. Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a
        time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal
        the bag and shake to coat well. Place the coated
        chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with
        a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL
        THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY.
        THIS IS CRUCIAL!\n\n
    3. Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3
        to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
        Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can
        hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.
        When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let
        cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked
        through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat
        again and continue to fry until crispy. \n\n
    4. Drain the fried chicken on paper towels.
        Depending on how much chicken you have,
        you may have to fry in a few shifts.
        Keep the finished chicken in a
        slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.\n\n
